# Apart.vim

*A simple auto-bracket/quote plugin for Vim.*

This plugin is designed to work for all file types, but offers additional
functionality for the [S-expression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S-expression)
based languages.

**Note**: this plugin is currently still a work-in-progress.


## Installation

**Note**: this plugin only works on Vim 8.2+ with Vim9script, so it **won't**
work on Neovim.

Installation of Apart can be performed by using your preferred plugin management
solution.  If you don't have a Vim package manager I recommend using Vim
8 packages by running the following 2 commands in your shell.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/axvr/apart.vim ~/.vim/pack/plugins/start/apart
vim +'helptags ~/.vim/pack/plugins/start/apart/doc/' +q
```


## Usage

**Work in progress!**
